## Purpose

The **WISPNET** project is an experimental Local Area Network (LAN) created by William S. Popovici. The primary goals of this project are:

- **Repairing and utilizing technology**: To explore and experiment with modern and older networking technologies and systems.
- **Learning web development**: The current focus is on gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **IOserver**:Originally a local home server, the IOserver project is one of the many subprojects of the **WISPNET** Project, and is a JavaScript game space, which we would love a contribution to!

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience in networking, coding, and web development.
